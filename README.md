Image Recognition (First attempt at Neural Networks &amp; AI)

The code can be accessed by clicking on the file from the repository and then choosing to open it in Google Colab.

In order to execute the application, the program imports certain data files from the userâ€™s google drive account. In the original program this was from the test drawings I uploaded to my account and then accessed through the Google Colab program. The import location may vary and therefore the code is not yet universal. The program works with limited amounts of drawings (10) as too much data would increase training time exponentially, but this can be altered in the future.
