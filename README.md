Image Recognition (First attempt at Neural Networks & AI)

NOTICE: This code is only executable on/with my google drive account as the files necessary for running it are only available on my google drive, this is for ease of use with google colab.

This program uses .npy files from Google's Sketch.io dataset to train the network to recognize certain objects (10 in this case, more requires more memory that is not avaialble for free on google colab, but the capacity to add more items is possible). Then, drawings I have uploaded to my google drive that are reflected as the program output, are inputted to the network and it then labels the drawing whatever the network thinks it is. This is image recognition on a small, but functional stage!
